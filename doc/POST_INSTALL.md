## List of known public services

* Ask on one of the following rooms: #mautrix_yunohost:matrix.fdn.fr or #telegram:maunium.net

## Bridging usage

** Note that several Telegram and Matrix users can be bridged, each Telegram account has its own bot administration room. If they are in a same Telegram group, only one matrix room will be created. **

### Bridge a Telegram user and a Matrix user

* First your Matrix user or Synapse Server has to be authorized in the Configuration of the bridge (see below)
* Then, invite the bot (default @telegrambot:yoursynapse.domain) in this new Mautrix-Telegram bot administration room.
    * If the Bot does bot accept, see the [troubleshooting page](https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/general/troubleshooting.html)
* Send ``!tg help`` to the bot in the created room to know how to control the bot.

#### Logging into Telegram account

* Type ``login`` or ``login-qr`` (untested) in main management room (`!tg` in any bridge room)
* Follow setup instructions from bot
* By defaults, only conversations with very recent messages and groups will be suggested to be bridged
* Accept invitations to the bridged chat rooms

#### Registering the Bridge as a primary device (untested)

* Type ``!tg register <phone>``, where ``<phone>`` is your phone number in the internation format with no space, e.g. ``!tg register +33612345678``
* Answer in the bot room with the verification code that you reveived in SMS.
* Set a profile name with ``!tg set-profile-name <name>``

### Double puppeting

* Log in with ``login-matrix <access token>``
* After logging in, the default Matrix puppet of your Telegram account should leave rooms and your account should join all rooms the puppet was in automatically.
