A puppeting bridge between Matrix and Telegram packaged as a YunoHost service. Messages, notifications (and sometimes media) are bridged between a Telegram user and a Matrix user. Currently the Matrix user can NOT invite other Matrix user in a bridged Telegram room, so only someone with a Telegram account can participate to Telegram group conversations. The ["Mautrix-Telegram"](https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/python/telegram/index.html) bridge is a Synapse App Service and relies on PostgreSQL. Therefore, [Synapse for YunoHost](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/synapse_ynh) should be installed beforehand.
